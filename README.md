Analysis of Citibike Rideshare program for 2016
--------------------------------------------------
Data: Data of all rides in the months June - August in 2016
  
  The script performs various exploratory analysis on the citibike data to gain insights and to answer business questions to drive the   decision making process. Graphs are plotted using Google maps to analyze the ride pattern.
  
  Packages used:
  ---------------
  a.	Igraph
  b.	Fields
  c.	Plyr
  d.	Dplyr
  e.	Ggmap
  
  Results:
  ----------
•	The month having the most utilization/frequency of services (bike sharing) was the month of August.
•	The stations with the most traffic were Pershing Square North, and West Street & Chambers Street.
•	Males (1) were the majority users for this program, greater than the other two demographics put together.
•	An average user rode a distance on 1.169 miles.
•	Central Park & 6th Avenue, along with Yankee Ferry Terminal are the stations having the strongest bonds.
•	5-6 PM was the most frequent utilization of the service, second was 8-9 AM.
•	2.2% of the rides ended, and originated at the same station.
•	As per the bike-id (a serial number unique to every cycle of the Citibike inventory (bicycles)), a bikeshare cycle was moved approximately 400 times over the period of 92 days.

Conclusion and Recommendations:
--------------------------------
•	If we observe carefully the travel patterns of tourists and many a wanderer. We would find that the most ideal season for individuals to witness the beauty of the nation would be in the months of April through to August [5]. So, it comes as no surprise that thee month of August would stand out in the months across which the analysis was conducted. Here it is assumed that the travel patterns of tourist are the only factor that influences this outcome, because of the proximity of the bike station to sights and attractions of tourist interest. Else it will be hard to approximate a reason 
•	Pershing Square North, and West Street & Chambers Street were the majority traffic stations due to their proximity to the NY PATH public transit system. Also, they are quite close to downtown Manhattan so they may also be accredited to be centrally located.
•	Males forming the majority demographic of the commuting cyclist, could be linked to the fact that the other genders are more cautious utilizing a two-wheeled contraption. It may also be that due to health or physical restraints they find it hard to make use of a more physically assertive mode of transport.
•	An average rider rode the cycle for 1.169 miles, and the cycles were most used during the ‘rush’ hours (office times). This would be a clear indicator that the majority of the Citibike Rideshare program users would be working professionals seeking for a more convenient, and less crowded mode of transport. Also, being moved 400 times in over 92 days shows that one cycle was probably used 2 times a day by two different commuters, albeit some time apart in usage. 
[2 individuals*(92 days*2 times a day)] = 368 times commuted
•	We would also recommend that in 2.2% of the cases where the inventory (bicycles) is replenished at individual stations utilizing trucks. It would be more profitable for the company to leave the cycles where they are. This will cut costs, increasing the overall efficiency of their service that too without adding additional inventory (bicycles).
•	Also, if two or more low frequency (read usage) stations were to be coupled and substituted with one station, at equal distance to both the previous ones. This too would save costs and inventory (bicycles). Allowing for the inventory (bicycles) of one station to be utilized in a higher frequency area, again without purchasing new inventory (bicycles).
•	In the near future, when this program adds more cyclists. It would be highly customer friendly, and image building for Citibank to collaborate with the NY Municipality to demarcate specific cyclist only tracks. This would also encourage more users to come onboard as ride sharers.
